## 3. Check Your Data

Look in the `output/` folder:
- `connection_status.csv` - What data was found
- `sample_orders.csv` - Your actual order data
- `sample_customers.csv` - Your customer data
- `sample_products.csv` - Your product data

## 4. Common Issues

**"Authentication failed"**: Check your token starts with `shpat_`  
**"Shop domain not found"**: Use format `mystore.myshopify.com` (no https://)  
**"No data found"**: Your store might be empty - create a test order

## 5. What's Next?

âœ… **Basic connection working?** Try the other pipelines  
âœ… **Ready for analytics?** Check the main [README.md](README.md)  
âœ… **Want incremental loading?** Change `sync_mode` to `"incremental"`

**That's it! You're connected to Shopify in under 2 minutes.**
