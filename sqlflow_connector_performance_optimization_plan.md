# SQLFlow Connector Performance Optimization Plan

## Overview

This document outlines a plan to optimize the performance of SQLFlow connectors. The goal is to identify and implement high-impact, low-complexity optimizations that improve the efficiency, memory usage, and speed of data processing in the connector framework, with minimal risk to stability.

## Current Architecture Analysis

SQLFlow has a well-designed connector architecture with:

1. **Base classes**:
   - `Connector` - Base class for all source connectors
   - `DestinationConnector` - Base class for all destination connectors

2. **Data Exchange**:
   - `DataChunk` - Container for batches of data with PyArrow/pandas interoperability

3. **Resilience Patterns**:
   - Retry, circuit breaker, and rate limiting capabilities
   - Connector-specific resilience profiles

4. **Performance Considerations**:
   - Lazy property evaluation in `DataChunk`
   - Batch processing in many connectors
   - PyArrow integration for efficient data handling

## Performance Bottlenecks and Opportunities

### 1. Memory Management
- **Issue**: Unnecessary data conversions between pandas and Arrow formats
- **Issue**: Large intermediate objects during data processing
- **Issue**: Suboptimal batch sizes for different connector types

### 2. I/O Efficiency
- **Issue**: Sequential file processing where parallelism could be beneficial
- **Issue**: Redundant file system operations
- **Issue**: Network-bound operations without sufficient pipelining

### 3. Computational Efficiency
- **Issue**: Unnecessary data copies during processing
- **Issue**: Suboptimal algorithm implementations
- **Issue**: Lack of vectorized operations

### 4. Configuration and Defaults
- **Issue**: Default configuration values not optimized for performance
- **Issue**: Missing performance hints in user-facing APIs
