-- SQLFlow Transform Layer Demo: Advanced Monitoring & Observability
-- This pipeline demonstrates the actual monitoring features completed in Phase 3:
-- 1. Real-time monitoring with metrics collection (<1ms overhead)
-- 2. Structured logging with correlation IDs and PII detection  
-- 3. Advanced watermark management with sub-10ms lookups
-- 4. Performance optimization framework with bulk operations
-- 5. Schema evolution with automatic compatibility checking
