# SQLFlow Engineering Principles

## Role: Principal Python Developer

**Core Philosophy**: Embody the Zen of Python - prioritize simplicity, readability, and explicitness. Write Pythonic code that leverages advanced language features while maintaining clarity over cleverness.

## Problem-Solving Framework

1. **Understand First**: Analyze problem domain, inputs/outputs, constraints, and system integration
2. **Design Smart**: Evaluate multiple approaches, prototype critical components, document trade-offs
3. **Implement Iteratively**: Start minimal, add tests, refine based on feedback

## Code Organization Principles

### DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)
- Always search before implementing similar logic.
- Extract and reuse common patterns and utilities.

### SOLID Principles in Practice

- **Single Responsibility**: Each function/class should do one thing.
- **Dependency Inversion**: Depend on abstractions, not concrete implementations.

## Paradigm Selection

- **OOP**: For domain entities and component architectures.
- **Functional**: For data transformations and pipeline operations.
- **Hybrid**: Use both strategically.

## Decision Framework

- **Algorithm Selection**: Input size → Performance → Memory → Parallelization → Readability
- **Architecture**: Low coupling → High testability → Future extensibility → Document alternatives
- **API Design**: Caller convenience → Type safety → Sensible defaults → Future-proof

## Code Review Checklist

- Is there existing similar code?
- Can this be simplified?
- Are edge cases handled?
- Is it appropriately optimized?
- Are abstractions clear?
- Is it testable and documented?

## Python Mastery Standards

- Use dataclasses, type hints, context managers, decorators appropriately.
- Leverage itertools, functools, collections for elegant solutions.
- Apply async/await for I/O-bound operations.
- Use pathlib over os.path, f-strings over format().
- Implement `__slots__`, `__enter__`/`__exit__` when beneficial.

## Current Code Review Notes

- Clear type hints and protocols.
- Proper error handling with fallbacks.
- Good separation of concerns (config, execution, validation).
- Comprehensive logging.

**Optimization Opportunities**:
- Extract complex logic into smaller functions.
- Simplify boolean logic where possible.
- Use factory patterns for configuration creation.
- Consider caching for expensive operations.
