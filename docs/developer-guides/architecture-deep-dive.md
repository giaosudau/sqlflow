    CLI->>Parser: Parse pipeline file
    Parser->>Parser: Build AST
    Parser->>Planner: Abstract Syntax Tree
    
    Planner->>Planner: Analyze dependencies

```

### Error Handling Philosophy

**Principle**: Fail fast, fail clearly, recover gracefully.

```mermaid
graph TB
    Error[Error Detected] --> Isolate[Isolate Failure]
    Isolate --> Context[Capture Context]
    Context --> Report[Clear Error Message]
    Report --> Decide{Recoverable?}
    
    Decide -->|Yes| Recover[Automatic Recovery]
    Decide -->|No| Fail[Graceful Failure]
    
    Recover --> Continue[Continue Execution]
    Fail --> Cleanup[Resource Cleanup]
    
    Continue --> Success[Success]
    Cleanup --> UserAction[User Action Required]
```

**Error Categories**:
1. **Syntax Errors**: Clear parsing messages with line numbers
2. **Dependency Errors**: Cycle detection and resolution suggestions
3. **Runtime Errors**: Context-aware error messages with recovery options
4. **Resource Errors**: Automatic retry with backoff strategies

## Performance Architecture

### Execution Strategy

**Philosophy**: Optimize for the common case, handle edge cases gracefully.

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph "Optimization Layers"
        SQL[SQL Optimization] --> Parallel[Parallel Execution]
        Parallel --> Memory[Memory Management]
        Memory --> Streaming[Streaming Processing]
    end
    
    subgraph "Performance Monitoring"
        Metrics[Execution Metrics] --> Profiling[Performance Profiling]
        Profiling --> Adaptation[Adaptive Optimization]
    end
    
    SQL --> Metrics
    Streaming --> Adaptation
```

**Optimization Strategies**:
- **DuckDB Columnar**: Vectorized operations for analytical workloads
- **Parallel Execution**: Multi-core utilization for independent operations
- **Memory Management**: Intelligent spilling for larger-than-memory datasets
- **Connection Pooling**: Efficient resource reuse across operations

### Scalability Model

**Vertical First**: Optimize single-machine performance before distributed complexity.

```mermaid
graph LR
    subgraph "Vertical Scaling"
        CPU[Multi-Core Processing]
        Memory[Memory Optimization]
        Storage[NVMe Storage]
        Network[Local Processing]
    end
    
    subgraph "Horizontal Scaling"
        Temporal[Temporal Decomposition]
        Domain[Domain Decomposition]
        Pipeline[Pipeline Parallelism]
    end
    
    CPU --> Temporal
    Memory --> Domain
    Storage --> Pipeline
```

**Rationale**:
- 80% of analytical workloads fit on single machines
- Vertical scaling eliminates network overhead
- Simpler debugging and operations
- Lower total cost of ownership

## Extension Architecture

### Plugin System Design

**Philosophy**: Extensions should enhance, never complicate.

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph "Core System"
        Registry[Component Registry]
        Interface[Standard Interfaces]
        Discovery[Auto Discovery]
    end
    
    subgraph "Extension Types"
        UDFs[Python UDFs]
        Connectors[Data Connectors]
        Engines[Execution Engines]
        Formats[Data Formats]
    end
    
    Registry --> UDFs
    Registry --> Connectors
    Registry --> Engines
    Registry --> Formats
    
    Interface --> Registry
    Discovery --> Registry
```

**Extension Principles**:
1. **Auto-discovery**: Extensions register themselves
2. **Standard interfaces**: Consistent patterns across extension types
3. **Graceful degradation**: Missing extensions don't break core functionality
4. **Isolated execution**: Extension failures don't crash the system

## Future Architecture Vision

### Extensible Ecosystem

**Vision**: SQLFlow becomes a platform for data pipeline innovation.

```sql
-- Community-driven function ecosystem
PYTHON_UDFS FROM "ml-preprocessing>=2.0";
PYTHON_UDFS FROM "finance-analytics>=1.5";

-- Industry-specific connectors
SOURCE customer_data FROM salesforce;
SOURCE financial_data FROM bloomberg;

-- Intelligent optimization
-- System automatically chooses optimal execution strategy
SELECT customer_id, predict_churn(features)
FROM large_customer_dataset;  -- Auto-detected: streaming processing
```

**Technical Foundation**:
- Plugin architecture already supports extensibility
- Registry patterns enable package management
- Performance monitoring enables intelligent optimization
- Clean interfaces support multiple execution engines

### Multi-Engine Future

**Vision**: Support multiple execution engines while preserving SQL simplicity.

```yaml
# Environment-specific engine selection
profiles:
  development:
    engine: duckdb-memory
    
  production:
    engine: duckdb-persistent
    storage: nvme-optimized
    
  distributed:
    engine: spark-cluster
    cluster: production-hadoop
```

**Benefits**:
- Start simple, scale when needed
- SQL interface remains consistent
- Existing pipelines work across engines
- Performance optimization without rewriting

## Summary

SQLFlow's architecture achieves its goal of democratizing data pipeline development through principled design decisions:

**For Data Analysts**: SQL they know, enhanced with Python power when needed
**For Data Engineers**: Production-ready infrastructure without operational complexity
**For Organizations**: Faster insights with lower total cost of ownership

The architecture's success comes from relentless focus on the user experience while maintaining the technical rigor needed for production data systems. Every component asks: "Does this make data analysis more accessible?" The answer shapes every interface, every optimization, and every extension point.
