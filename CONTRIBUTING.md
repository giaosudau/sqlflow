We welcome contributions to SQLFlow! As an early-stage project, we are excited to build a community that can help shape its future.

## Getting Started

*   **Found a Bug?** Please open an issue in our GitHub repository, providing as much detail as possible, including steps to reproduce, SQLFlow version, and your environment.

*   **Want to Contribute Code?** That's fantastic! 
    *   For now, please start by opening an issue to discuss the change you'd like to make. This helps ensure that your contribution aligns with the project's direction and avoids duplicated effort.
    *   Look for issues tagged `good first issue` or `help wanted` for areas where you can jump in.

## Development Setup (Placeholder)

(We will add more detailed instructions on setting up a development environment, coding standards, and the pull request process as the project matures.)
