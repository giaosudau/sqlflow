WHERE c.created_at >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL 12 MONTHS
GROUP BY DATE_TRUNC('month', c.created_at)
ORDER BY acquisition_month DESC;
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Incremental Loading Setup

**Always use incremental mode for production:**

```sql
-- Efficient incremental configuration
SOURCE shopify_orders TYPE SHOPIFY PARAMS {
  "shop_domain": "${SHOPIFY_DOMAIN}",
  "access_token": "${SHOPIFY_ACCESS_TOKEN}",
  "sync_mode": "incremental",        -- Essential for efficiency
  "cursor_field": "updated_at",      -- Default field for incremental
  "lookback_window": "P7D"          -- 7-day buffer prevents data loss
};

-- Use APPEND mode for incremental data
LOAD orders_data FROM shopify_orders MODE APPEND;
```

### 2. Financial Data Handling

**Ensure accuracy for financial calculations:**

```sql
-- Always include refunds for accurate financial reporting
SOURCE shopify_orders TYPE SHOPIFY PARAMS {
  "shop_domain": "${SHOPIFY_DOMAIN}",
  "access_token": "${SHOPIFY_ACCESS_TOKEN}",
  "include_refunds": true,           -- Critical for accuracy
  "financial_status_filter": ["paid", "pending", "authorized"]  -- Revenue focus
};

-- Handle monetary values as strings to preserve precision
SELECT 
  order_id,
  CAST(total_price AS DECIMAL(10,2)) as total_price,
  CAST(total_refunded AS DECIMAL(10,2)) as total_refunded,
  CAST(total_price AS DECIMAL(10,2)) - CAST(total_refunded AS DECIMAL(10,2)) as net_revenue
FROM orders_data;
```

### 3. Performance Optimization

**Optimize for large datasets:**

```sql
-- Use date filtering for better performance
CREATE TABLE recent_orders AS
SELECT *
FROM orders_data
WHERE created_at >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL 90 DAYS;

-- Index frequently queried fields
CREATE INDEX idx_orders_created_at ON orders_data(created_at);
CREATE INDEX idx_orders_customer_id ON orders_data(customer_id);
```

### 4. Error Handling

**The connector automatically handles common issues:**

- **Shop Maintenance**: Automatic detection and retry
- **Rate Limits**: Intelligent backoff and queuing
- **Schema Changes**: Automatic field adaptation
- **Network Issues**: Exponential retry with circuit breaker

**Monitor connector health:**

```bash
# Test connection before running pipelines
sqlflow connect test shopify_orders

# Check connector health
sqlflow connect health shopify_orders
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues & Solutions

#### Authentication Errors

**Error**: `Authentication failed - invalid access token`

**Solution**:
1. Verify your private app is installed and active
2. Check token has required permissions (read_orders, read_customers, read_products)
3. Ensure token is correctly set in environment variable

```bash
# Verify token is set
echo $SHOPIFY_ACCESS_TOKEN

# Test connection
sqlflow connect test shopify_orders
```

#### Rate Limiting

**Error**: `Rate limit exceeded - please retry later`

**Solution**: The connector handles this automatically with intelligent backoff. If persistent:

1. Reduce concurrent pipelines
2. Increase `lookback_window` for more efficient incremental loads
3. Use `batch_size` parameter to reduce request size

```sql
-- Optimized configuration for high-volume stores
SOURCE shopify_orders TYPE SHOPIFY PARAMS {
  "shop_domain": "${SHOPIFY_DOMAIN}",
  "access_token": "${SHOPIFY_ACCESS_TOKEN}",
  "sync_mode": "incremental",
  "lookback_window": "P1D",    -- Shorter window for frequent runs
  "batch_size": 100           -- Smaller batches
};
```

#### Missing Data

**Error**: Missing orders or incomplete data

**Solution**:

1. Check `financial_status_filter` isn't too restrictive
2. Verify date ranges in your queries
3. Enable all data types:

```sql
-- Include all order types for complete data
SOURCE shopify_orders TYPE SHOPIFY PARAMS {
  "shop_domain": "${SHOPIFY_DOMAIN}",
  "access_token": "${SHOPIFY_ACCESS_TOKEN}",
  "financial_status_filter": ["authorized", "pending", "paid", "partially_paid", "refunded", "voided", "partially_refunded"],
  "include_fulfillments": true,
  "include_refunds": true
};
```

#### Schema Changes

**Info**: `Schema changes detected - adding missing fields`

**Action**: No action required. The connector automatically adapts to schema changes by:
- Adding missing fields with null values
- Preserving existing data structure
- Logging changes for awareness

### Performance Optimization

#### Large Store Optimization

For stores with 10k+ orders:

```sql
-- Use date partitioning for better performance
CREATE TABLE orders_partitioned AS
SELECT 
  *,
  DATE_TRUNC('month', created_at) as partition_month
FROM orders_data;

-- Query recent data only
SELECT * 
FROM orders_partitioned 
WHERE partition_month >= DATE_TRUNC('month', CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL 6 MONTHS);
```

#### Memory Management

For memory-constrained environments:

```sql
-- Process data in smaller chunks
SOURCE shopify_orders TYPE SHOPIFY PARAMS {
  "shop_domain": "${SHOPIFY_DOMAIN}",
  "access_token": "${SHOPIFY_ACCESS_TOKEN}",
  "batch_size": 50,           -- Smaller batches
  "timeout_seconds": 120      -- Longer timeout for processing
};
```

## Migration from Other Tools

### From Airbyte

**Parameter Mapping:**

| Airbyte Parameter | SQLFlow Parameter | Notes |
|------------------|-------------------|-------|
| `shop` | `shop_domain` | Use full `.myshopify.com` format |
| `credentials.api_password` | `access_token` | Direct mapping |
| `start_date` | Use incremental mode | More efficient than full refresh |

**Example Migration:**

```json
// Airbyte configuration
{
  "shop": "mystore",
  "credentials": {
    "api_password": "shpat_xxx"
  },
  "start_date": "2023-01-01T00:00:00Z"
}
```

```sql
-- SQLFlow equivalent (better performance)
SOURCE shopify_orders TYPE SHOPIFY PARAMS {
  "shop_domain": "mystore.myshopify.com",
  "access_token": "shpat_xxx",
  "sync_mode": "incremental"  -- More efficient than start_date
};
```

### From dltHub

**Configuration Comparison:**

```python
# dltHub setup
import dlt
from dlt.sources.shopify import shopify_source

pipeline = dlt.pipeline(
    pipeline_name="shopify_pipeline",
    destination="duckdb"
)

source = shopify_source(
    private_app_password="shpat_xxx",
    shop_url="https://mystore.myshopify.com"
)
```

```sql
-- SQLFlow equivalent (simpler setup)
SOURCE shopify_orders TYPE SHOPIFY PARAMS {
  "shop_domain": "mystore.myshopify.com", 
  "access_token": "shpat_xxx",
  "sync_mode": "incremental"
};

LOAD orders FROM shopify_orders MODE APPEND;
```

**Benefits of Migration:**
- **Simpler configuration** (3 parameters vs complex Python setup)
- **Built-in analytics** (no additional modeling required)
- **Better error handling** (automatic retry and maintenance detection)
- **Faster performance** (optimized for SME use cases)
