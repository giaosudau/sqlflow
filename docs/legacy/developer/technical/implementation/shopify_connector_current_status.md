   CREATE TABLE customer_ltv_analysis AS
   SELECT 
     c.customer_id,
     c.customer_email,
     c.first_name || ' ' || c.last_name as full_name,
     COUNT(DISTINCT o.order_id) as total_orders,
     SUM(o.total_price) as total_spent,
     AVG(o.total_price) as avg_order_value,
     -- Customer classification logic
     CASE 
       WHEN total_spent >= 1000 AND total_orders >= 10 THEN 'VIP'
       WHEN total_spent >= 500 AND total_orders >= 5 THEN 'Loyal'
       WHEN total_orders >= 3 THEN 'Regular'
       WHEN total_orders = 1 THEN 'One-time'
       ELSE 'Emerging'
     END as customer_classification
   ```

2. **Product Performance Analytics**
   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE product_performance_analytics AS
   SELECT 
     p.product_id,
     p.product_title,
     p.vendor,
     SUM(o.quantity) as total_quantity_sold,
     SUM(o.line_total) as total_revenue,
     COUNT(DISTINCT o.customer_id) as unique_customers,
     -- Cross-selling analysis
     COUNT(DISTINCT o.order_id) as orders_containing_product
   ```

3. **Financial Reconciliation & Validation**
   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE financial_reconciliation AS
   SELECT 
     DATE(o.created_at) as order_date,
     SUM(o.total_price) as gross_revenue,
     SUM(o.total_discounts) as total_discounts,
     SUM(o.total_tax) as total_tax,
     SUM(o.total_refunded) as total_refunds,
     -- Net revenue calculation
     SUM(o.total_price) - SUM(o.total_refunded) as net_revenue
   ```

4. **Geographic Performance Analysis**
   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE geographic_performance AS
   SELECT 
     o.shipping_country,

     COUNT(DISTINCT o.order_id) as total_orders,
     SUM(o.total_price) as total_revenue,
     -- Regional fulfillment rate
     COUNT(CASE WHEN o.fulfillment_status = 'fulfilled' THEN 1 END) * 100.0 / COUNT(*) as fulfillment_rate
   ```

#### Testing & Quality Assurance (Day 5)
```python

        "maintenance", "temporarily unavailable", "service unavailable",
        "shop is not available", "503 service unavailable", "502 bad gateway"
    ]
    
    if any(indicator in str(error).lower() for indicator in maintenance_indicators):
        backoff_time = min(300, 60)  # Progressive backoff
        time.sleep(backoff_time)
        return True
    return False
```

STREAM_DEMAND_TRACKER = {
    "inventory_items": {
        "customer_requests": 0,  # Tracked via support tickets
        "business_value": "Stock management, reorder points, inventory analytics",
        "implementation_effort": 2,  # days
        "complexity": "low",
        "tier": "business_growth",
        "trigger_threshold": 3  # requests needed for development
    },
    "abandoned_checkouts": {
        "customer_requests": 0,
        "business_value": "Cart abandonment analysis, recovery campaigns", 
        "implementation_effort": 3,  # days
        "complexity": "medium",

    "cursor_field": "updated_at",
    "sme_priority": "high",
    "complexity": "low"
}

# Step 2: Copy existing read method (10 minutes)
def _read_new_stream(self, sync_mode: str, cursor_value: Optional[str] = None):
    """Read new stream data - copy from existing pattern."""
    try:
        api_params = self._build_new_stream_api_params(sync_mode, cursor_value)
        response = self._make_shopify_api_call("new_stream.json", api_params)
        items = response.get("new_stream", [])
        
        if items:
            processed_items = self._process_new_stream_batch(items)
            df = pd.DataFrame(processed_items)
            df = self._convert_new_stream_data_types(df)
            yield DataChunk(df)
        else:
            yield DataChunk(pd.DataFrame())
    except ConnectorError as e:
        logger.warning(f"ConnectorError in new_stream reading: {str(e)}")
        yield DataChunk(pd.DataFrame())

# Step 3: Add schema definition (4 minutes)
# Follow existing schema patterns with PyArrow
