# Shopify Destination Connector

The Shopify Destination connector is not yet implemented in SQLFlow.

Writing data to Shopify would typically involve using the Shopify Admin API to create or update objects like `products`, `customers`, or `inventory`.

If you have a use case for a Shopify destination, please [open an issue](https://github.com/sql-workflow/sqlflow/issues) on our GitHub repository to describe your requirements.
