- ✅ **Real Service Testing**: Integration tests use actual PostgreSQL and MinIO services instead of mocks
- ✅ **Error Classification**: Proper handling of retryable vs non-retryable errors based on actual service behavior
- ✅ **Message Accuracy**: Test assertions match actual service error messages for better debugging
- ✅ **DRY Testing Infrastructure**: Unified testing approach that reuses shared utilities and avoids code duplication
- ✅ **Developer Experience**: Simple `./run_integration_tests.sh` command provides comprehensive testing capabilities

**Filter Enhancement Details:**
- ✅ **Enhanced Query Building**: PostgreSQL `_build_query` method supports comparison operators
- ✅ **Multiple Formats**: String-based (`">= 300"`), dictionary-based (`{">": 300, "<": 500}`), legacy equality
- ✅ **Backward Compatibility**: All existing filter patterns continue to work unchanged
- ✅ **SQL Safety**: Proper parameterization prevents SQL injection
- ✅ **Test Coverage**: Comprehensive validation script created (`validate_fixes.py`)

**DRY Refactoring Summary:**
- ✅ **Shared Utilities Reuse**: Integration test script leverages existing `ci_utils.sh` functions instead of reimplementing Docker service management
- ✅ **CI Consistency**: Same utility functions used by quick_start.sh, ci.yml, and run_integration_tests.sh
- ✅ **Code Elimination**: Removed duplicate service management, health checks, and Docker operations code
- ✅ **Maintainability**: Single source of truth for service management in `examples/phase2_integration_demo/scripts/ci_utils.sh`
- ✅ **Documentation Integration**: Testing documentation links to existing specs and utilities rather than duplicating information

**Next Steps:** All resilience integration tasks completed successfully. Ready to proceed to Task 2.5 (Phase 2 Demo Integration).
