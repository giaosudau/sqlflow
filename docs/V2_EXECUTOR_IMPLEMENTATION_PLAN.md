# SQLFlow V2 Executor Implementation Plan

**Author:** Raymond Hettinger  
**Review Panel:** Martin Fowler, Kent Beck, Robert Cecil Martin, Andy Hunt, Dave Thomas, Jon Bentley  
**Date:** 2023-10-27  
**Status:** Approved Implementation Roadmap

## Executive Summary

This document outlines a systematic, risk-mitigated approach to implement the V2 Executor architecture using the OODA (Observe, Orient, Decide, Act) framework. The plan ensures zero-disruption migration from the current 3,320-line monolithic `LocalExecutor` to a composable, observable, and maintainable V2 system.

**Key Success Metrics:**
- 100% feature parity with existing executors
- Zero breaking changes during transition
- Gradual adoption with rollback capabilities
- Comprehensive test coverage at each phase
- Clear performance improvements in observability

## OODA Framework Application

### 🔍 **OBSERVE** - Current State Analysis

#### Current Executor Ecosystem Analysis

**Primary Executors:**

- DuckDB Engine integration
- Connector system (resilience patterns)
- Profile management system
- Watermark/state management
- UDF discovery and execution

### 🧭 **ORIENT** - Strategic Understanding

#### Architecture Constraints
1. **Zero-Downtime Migration**: Current system must remain functional
2. **Backward Compatibility**: All existing APIs must work unchanged
3. **Performance**: V2 must match or exceed current performance
4. **Testing**: Each phase must be thoroughly tested before proceeding

#### Risk Assessment
- **High Risk**: Database connection management during transition
- **Medium Risk**: UDF registration and execution changes
- **Low Risk**: Observability layer additions (non-breaking)

### 🎯 **DECIDE** - Implementation Strategy

**Strategy: Gradual Strangler Fig Pattern**
- Build V2 components alongside V1
- Route traffic incrementally to V2
- Deprecate V1 components only after V2 is proven
- Maintain compatibility bridge throughout

- Comprehensive UDF regression testing
- Fallback to V1 UDF system on failures

### **Testing Strategy**

#### Continuous Integration Requirements

## Conclusion

This implementation plan provides a systematic, risk-mitigated approach to migrating SQLFlow to the V2 Executor architecture. By following the OODA framework and implementing in careful phases, we ensure:

1. **Zero disruption** to current operations
2. **Improved observability** and maintainability
3. **Enhanced performance** through better architecture
4. **Future extensibility** for new requirements

The strangler fig pattern allows us to build confidence in the V2 system while maintaining the reliability of the existing system. Each phase has clear success criteria and rollback procedures, ensuring we can adapt to any challenges discovered during implementation.

**Next Steps:**
1. Review and approval by the technical panel
2. Resource allocation and timeline confirmation
3. Phase 1 kickoff with observability implementation
4. Regular checkpoint reviews and plan adjustments as needed
