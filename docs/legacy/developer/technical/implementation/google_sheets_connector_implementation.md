# Google Sheets Connector Implementation

## Summary of Fixes
- Fixed universe domain validation in credentials to work with different Google API library versions
- Updated test mocks to properly handle method chaining in Google API client
- Improved HTTP request/response mocking
- Fixed test cases to use direct module imports for patching
- Enhanced mock setup to better match actual API behavior

## Features Implemented
- Reading data from Google Sheets with support for headers
- Writing data to Google Sheets
- Service account authentication
- Range specification and sheet selection
- Schema discovery
- Connection testing
- **Bidirectional connector architecture** - Implemented as a full bidirectional connector with both read and write capabilities

## Bidirectional Implementation Details
- Inherits from `BidirectionalConnector` base class
- Uses `@register_bidirectional_connector` decorator for registration
- Implements both `read()` and `write()` methods with proper validation
- Supports the full connector lifecycle for both ingestion and export operations
- Automatically registered in source, export, and bidirectional connector registries
- Takes advantage of runtime method validation to ensure both read/write capabilities

## Usage Examples

### Reading Data (Source)
```sql
SOURCE monthly_budget TYPE GOOGLE_SHEETS PARAMS {
  "credentials_file": "path/to/service-account-key.json",
  "spreadsheet_id": "1a2b3c4d5e6f7g8h9i0j",
  "sheet_name": "Budget2023",
  "range": "A1:F100",
  "has_header": true
};

LOAD budget_data FROM monthly_budget;
```

### Writing Data (Export)
```sql
EXPORT
  SELECT department, SUM(salary) AS total_salary
  FROM employees
  GROUP BY department
TO "Department Salary Report"
TYPE GOOGLE_SHEETS
OPTIONS {
  "credentials_file": "path/to/service-account-key.json",
  "spreadsheet_id": "1a2b3c4d5e6f7g8h9i0j",
  "sheet_name": "SalaryReport",
  "has_header": true
};
```

## Next Steps
- Add support for OAuth authentication (optional)
- Enhance error handling
- Add support for access control
- Consider adding batch operations for large datasets
- Implement incremental loading capabilities
- Add additional formatting options for better spreadsheet presentation
- Improve performance for large sheets through pagination
