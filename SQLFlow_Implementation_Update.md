# SQLFlow Implementation Progress Update

## Epic 1: Conditional Execution (IF/ELSE)

### Completed Tasks

#### Task 1.1: Lexer & AST Updates for Conditional Syntax
✅ Complete - Implemented token types and AST node structures for conditional blocks
- Added IF, THEN, ELSE_IF, ELSE, END_IF token types
- Created ConditionalBranchStep and ConditionalBlockStep AST classes
- Added validation logic for conditional AST nodes

#### Task 1.2: Parser Implementation for Conditional Blocks
✅ Complete - Implemented parser support for conditional syntax
- Added support for parsing IF/THEN/ELSE/END IF blocks
- Implemented nested conditional parsing
- Added condition expression and branch statement parsing

#### Task 1.3: Condition Evaluation Logic
✅ Complete - Implemented in `sqlflow/core/evaluator.py`
- Created ConditionEvaluator class for resolving conditions against variable values
- Implemented variable substitution with support for default values
- Added secure AST-based evaluation of boolean expressions
- Implemented support for all comparison and logical operators
- Added comprehensive test suite in `tests/unit/core/test_evaluator.py`

#### Task 1.4: Planner Integration for Conditional Resolution
✅ Complete - Updated in `sqlflow/core/planner.py`
- Added methods to flatten conditional blocks during planning
- Implemented conditional resolution to select active branch based on variables
- Updated build_plan to handle variables and conditional evaluation
- Created comprehensive test suite in `tests/unit/core/test_conditional_planner.py`

### Remaining Tasks

#### Task 1.5: DAG Builder Update for Conditionals
- Ensure DAG visualization reflects only active branches
- No changes are likely needed if using the flattened pipeline approach

#### Task 1.6: Documentation & Examples
- Create documentation for conditional execution feature
- Create example conditional pipelines

## Epic 2: Python User-Defined Functions (UDFs)

All tasks for Python UDFs implementation are still pending.
