## Customer-Driven Development Framework

### üéØ Demand Tracking System

Our development prioritization is driven by **real customer demand** tracked through multiple channels:

```python
STREAM_DEMAND_TRACKER = {
    "stream_name": {
        "customer_requests": 0,           # Support tickets + feature requests
        "business_value": "description",  # Clear SME benefit
        "implementation_effort": 2,       # Days of development
        "complexity": "low|medium|high",  # Technical complexity
        "tier": "business_growth",        # Strategic tier
        "trigger_threshold": 3            # Requests needed for development
    }
}
```

### üìä Prioritization Matrix

**Implementation Triggers:**
1. **Customer Demand**: 3+ requests moves stream to development queue
2. **SME Business Value**: High-impact features prioritized
3. **Implementation Effort**: Low effort + high value = immediate priority
4. **Customer Retention**: Critical customer requests get priority handling

**Decision Framework:**
- **High Demand + Low Effort** ‚Üí Immediate development (1-2 weeks)
- **High Demand + Medium Effort** ‚Üí Next sprint planning (2-4 weeks)
- **Medium Demand + Low Effort** ‚Üí Planned development (1-2 months)
- **Low Demand + High Effort** ‚Üí Future consideration (3+ months)

### üîÑ Feedback Loop

**Customer Input Channels:**
- Support ticket analysis (weekly reviews)
- Feature request tracking (GitHub issues)
- Customer advisory board meetings (monthly)
- SME focus groups (quarterly)
- User analytics and usage patterns

**Response Time Commitments:**
- **Critical requests**: 1-2 weeks development
- **High-demand features**: 2-4 weeks development  
- **Standard requests**: 1-2 months development
- **Feature exploration**: 3+ months research

    }
}
```

## Technical Implementation Strategy

### üõ†Ô∏è Rapid Development Template

Our **15-minute stream addition process** enables quick response to customer demand:

#### 1. Stream Registration (1 minute)
```python
# Add to discover() method
def discover(self) -> List[str]:
    return [
        "orders", "customers", "products", "collections", "transactions",
        "inventory_items",  # ‚Üê New stream added here
    ]
```

#### 2. Copy-Paste Implementation (10 minutes)
```python
def _read_inventory_items(self, sync_mode: str, cursor_value: Optional[str] = None):
    """Read inventory items - copied from existing pattern."""
    try:
        # 1. Build API parameters (copy from _read_products)
        api_params = self._build_inventory_items_api_params(sync_mode, cursor_value)
        
        # 2. Make API call (standard pattern)
        response = self._make_shopify_api_call("inventory_items.json", api_params)
        items = response.get("inventory_items", [])
        
        # 3. Process and return (standard pattern)
        if items:
            processed_items = self._process_inventory_items_batch(items)
            df = pd.DataFrame(processed_items)
            df = self._convert_inventory_items_data_types(df)
            yield DataChunk(df)
        else:
            yield DataChunk(pd.DataFrame())
            
    except ConnectorError as e:
        logger.warning(f"ConnectorError in inventory_items reading: {str(e)}")
        yield DataChunk(pd.DataFrame())
```

#### 3. Schema Definition (4 minutes)
```python
# Add to get_schema() method
elif stream == "inventory_items":
    return Schema(
        pa.schema([
            pa.field("id", pa.int64()),
            pa.field("sku", pa.string()),
            pa.field("cost", pa.string()),
            pa.field("tracked", pa.bool_()),
            pa.field("created_at", pa.timestamp("s")),
            pa.field("updated_at", pa.timestamp("s")),
            # Follow existing patterns for consistency
        ])
    )
```

### üîÑ Quality Assurance Process

Every new stream follows our **production quality standards**:

#### Automated Testing Requirements
```python
def test_new_stream_basic_functionality(self):
    """Test basic read functionality."""
    
def test_new_stream_incremental_loading(self):
    """Test incremental mode with cursor fields."""
    
def test_new_stream_error_handling(self):
    """Test API error scenarios."""
    
def test_new_stream_schema_validation(self):
    """Test data types and schema compatibility."""
```

#### SME Analytics Template Creation
```sql
-- Example: Inventory Analytics Template
CREATE TABLE inventory_performance_analytics AS
SELECT 
  i.inventory_item_id,
  i.sku,
  i.cost,
  p.product_title,
  
  -- Stock metrics
  SUM(o.quantity) as total_sold,
  AVG(o.line_item_price) as avg_selling_price,
  AVG(o.line_item_price) - CAST(i.cost AS DECIMAL) as avg_margin,
  
  -- Performance ratios
  (AVG(o.line_item_price) - CAST(i.cost AS DECIMAL)) / AVG(o.line_item_price) * 100 as margin_percentage,
  
  -- Velocity analysis
  COUNT(DISTINCT DATE(o.created_at)) as active_days,
  SUM(o.quantity) / COUNT(DISTINCT DATE(o.created_at)) as avg_daily_velocity
  
FROM inventory_items i
LEFT JOIN products p ON i.product_id = p.product_id
LEFT JOIN orders o ON p.product_id = o.product_id
GROUP BY i.inventory_item_id, i.sku, i.cost, p.product_title
HAVING SUM(o.quantity) > 0
ORDER BY total_sold DESC;
```
