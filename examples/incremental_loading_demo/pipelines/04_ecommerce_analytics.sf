-- E-commerce Analytics Pipeline
-- This pipeline demonstrates a complete real-world scenario using all Phase 1 features:
-- 1. Multiple incremental sources working together
-- 2. Complex analytics with joins and aggregations
-- 3. Performance optimization through smart sync modes
-- 4. Industry-standard configuration patterns

-- ============================================================================
-- Phase 1 Demo: Complete E-commerce Analytics with Incremental Loading
-- ============================================================================

-- Step 1: Products - Reference data, changes infrequently
SOURCE products TYPE CSV PARAMS {
    "path": "${data_dir}/products.csv",
    "has_header": true,
    "sync_mode": "full_refresh",
    "primary_key": "product_id"
};

-- Step 2: Customers - Growing dataset, incremental updates
SOURCE customers_initial TYPE CSV PARAMS {
    "path": "${data_dir}/customers_initial.csv",
    "has_header": true,
    "sync_mode": "incremental",
    "cursor_field": "updated_at",
    "primary_key": "customer_id"
};

-- Step 3: Orders - High volume transactional data
SOURCE orders_day1 TYPE CSV PARAMS {
    "path": "${data_dir}/orders_day1.csv",
    "has_header": true,
    "sync_mode": "incremental",
    "cursor_field": "created_at",
    "primary_key": "order_id"
};

-- Step 4: Initial data load
LOAD products_table FROM products;
LOAD customers_table FROM customers_initial;
LOAD orders_table FROM orders_day1;

-- ============================================================================

-- Step 5: Customer segmentation analysis
CREATE TABLE customer_segments AS
SELECT 
    c.customer_id,
    c.name,
    c.status,
    COUNT(o.order_id) as order_count,
    COALESCE(SUM(o.amount), 0) as total_spent,
    COALESCE(AVG(o.amount), 0) as avg_order_value,
    CASE 
        WHEN COUNT(o.order_id) = 0 THEN 'No Orders'
        WHEN COUNT(o.order_id) = 1 THEN 'One-time Buyer'
        WHEN COUNT(o.order_id) <= 3 THEN 'Occasional Buyer'
        ELSE 'Frequent Buyer'
    END as customer_segment,
    MIN(o.order_date) as first_order,
    MAX(o.order_date) as last_order
FROM customers_table c
LEFT JOIN orders_table o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id
GROUP BY c.customer_id, c.name, c.status;

-- Step 6: Product performance analysis
CREATE TABLE product_analytics AS
SELECT 
    p.product_id,
    p.name,
    p.category,
    p.price,
    COUNT(o.order_id) as order_count,
    SUM(o.quantity) as total_quantity_sold,
    SUM(o.amount) as total_revenue,
    AVG(o.quantity) as avg_quantity_per_order,
    ROUND(SUM(o.amount) / SUM(o.quantity), 2) as avg_selling_price,
    ROUND(((SUM(o.amount) / SUM(o.quantity)) - p.price) / p.price * 100, 2) as price_variance_pct
FROM products_table p
LEFT JOIN orders_table o ON p.product_id = o.product_id
GROUP BY p.product_id, p.name, p.category, p.price
ORDER BY total_revenue DESC;

-- Step 7: Daily business metrics
CREATE TABLE daily_metrics AS
SELECT 
    DATE(o.order_date) as business_date,
    COUNT(DISTINCT o.customer_id) as unique_customers,
    COUNT(o.order_id) as total_orders,
    SUM(o.amount) as daily_revenue,
    AVG(o.amount) as avg_order_value,
    SUM(o.quantity) as total_items_sold,
    COUNT(DISTINCT o.product_id) as unique_products_sold
FROM orders_table o
GROUP BY DATE(o.order_date)
ORDER BY business_date;

-- Day 2: Incremental Updates - Showing Performance Benefits
-- ============================================================================

-- Step 8: Update customers (incremental - only new/changed records)
SOURCE customers_updates TYPE CSV PARAMS {

    "has_header": true,
    "sync_mode": "incremental",
    "cursor_field": "updated_at",
    "primary_key": "customer_id"

-- Step 9: Add Day 2 orders (incremental - only new orders)
SOURCE orders_day2 TYPE CSV PARAMS {
    "path": "${data_dir}/orders_day2.csv",
    "has_header": true,
    "sync_mode": "incremental",
    "cursor_field": "created_at",
    "primary_key": "order_id"
};

-- Step 10: Load incremental updates
-- Products: full_refresh (fast for small datasets)
-- Customers: incremental merge (only process changed records)
-- Orders: incremental append (only new orders)
LOAD products_table FROM products;                                    -- ~5 records always
LOAD customers_table FROM customers_updates MODE MERGE MERGE_KEYS (customer_id);  -- Only 5 new/changed
LOAD orders_table FROM orders_day2 MODE APPEND;                           -- Only 6 new orders
